# 2017-MSEProject-QAsystem

## Introduction
Question answering (QA) system is the system that answers questions posed in natural language automatically. It has emerged as a popular research area these years. Compared with search engine which returns a long list of possibly relevant and long documents, question answering system is preferable since it gives an exact and direct answer. Recently years, question answering systems has witnessed great success. In 2011, Watson, the question answering system developed by IBM Deep QA project, outperformed at two of the best and most successful human champions at a real time American TV quiz show.

This project aims to examine and reproduce the techniques adopted by Watson and to build a new QA system. The new system adopts Stanford NLP to process and analyze users inputs. And the system not only contains the fact-based questions like Watson but also apply a mix of machine learning technologies, such as Markov Logic Network, combine with the QA system to answer inference questions.
